## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A free [Expo](https://expo.dev/) account.
- An Android device/emulator to test your app
  - Install an MWA compliant wallet app on your device/emulator.
- If using Expo's cloud service `eas build`, no further setup is required.
- If building locally:
  - React Native and Android Envrionment [setup](https://docs.solanamobile.com/getting-started/development-setup)

### Initialize

Run the CLI command:

```
yarn create expo-app --template @solana-mobile/solana-mobile-expo-template
```

Choose your project name then navigate into the directory.

### Build and run the app

Once your app is initialized, follow the **["Running the app"](https://docs.solanamobile.com/react-native/expo#running-the-app)** guide to launch the template as a custom development build.
